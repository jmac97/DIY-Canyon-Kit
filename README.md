# DIY Canyon Kit

## Introduction
Like the flow of rivers that slowly carved away the Earth to create massive canyons, you too can create your own small scale canyon model by slowly dripping water onto the rock of your choosing! Put some water into the tube and let it go for your future ancestors to enjoy, if humans are still around then!

This device slowly drips water onto a rock, releasing all the water in the tube in about two minutes via a needle valve. The base contains an LED that “breathes,” lighting up the base, rock, and water that drips onto it. The enclosure is laser cut acrylic and all white plastic components (tube clips, rock holder), are made of 3D printed PLA.
